  "executive_summary": "The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Beach’s governance rests on a formal Board of Directors and subdued architecture of homeowner membership.  Ownership of a home automatically confers an association membership and obligations under the governing documents.  The Board of Directors (typically 9 members) and officers (President, Secretary, Treasurer) carry out corporate and association duties under Florida HOA law.  The Board may set budgets, levy annual assessments and dues on owners, maintain reserve accounts, and adopt financial policies (e.g. credit and collections policies).  All owners are mandatory members; Charter Memberships are generally non-transferable and expire when the parcel is sold.  Membership classes include Legacy (non-voting, limited use), Charter (full privileges).  Liquidated Initiation Fees and dues fund common facilities.  The Board establishes annual budgets and may adopt rules (fee schedules, fine schedules, credit policy) to ensure payment of assessments and protection of common assets.  Delinquent assessments accrue interest and trigger collection procedures; after 30 days of nonpayment, membership privileges (e.g. club and facility privileges) may be suspended, and rights may be foreclosed by lien.\n\nOwners elect Directors at the annual meeting by ballot or proxy.  Notice of all member meetings (annual or special) must be given in writing (e.g. mail/email) at least 14 days in advance.  A quorum of members (typically one quarter or one fifth of eligible votes, by person or proxy) is required for binding votes.  Special meetings can be called by the Board or upon written petition of the required percentage of members.  The Board meets regularly (often monthly); notice of board meetings is provided to the membership and meetings are open to members (subject to executive sessions).  Board decisions are by majority vote, with each Director holding one vote.  The Board may appoint committees (such as Architecture/Planning, Finance, Audit, Nominating, Social, Recreational Committees) with published charters, but each committee is advisory to the Board.\n\nThe Declaration of Covenants (CC&Rs) sets general use restrictions (property improvements, landscaping, noise, parking, pets, etc.), although the full text was not available in this search.  As guidelines, owners must maintain approved exterior standards, obtain ARC approval for new construction or changes, and abide by sign, pet, and other restrictions (for example, only domestic pets allowed, and no signs except as provided).  Common rules are supplemented by facility‐specific Rules and Regulations (e.g. tennis, golf, clubhouse, fitness rules) enforced under the association’s authority.  The Board ensures compliance via a Covenant Enforcement policy: infractions trigger notices, fines, or hearings.  The Board (through the General Manager) is empowered to issue violation notices and fines, suspend amenity privileges for noncompliance or delinquency, and, if needed, initiate lien foreclosure.  Owners have appeal rights; serious violations can be heard by a member grievance committee or at a board hearing per a published grievance procedure.\n\nFinancial policies require the Board to maintain adequate operating and reserve accounts, control spending (purchasing policies, outside counsel use, bank signatories), and manage investments.  Reserve funds (for capital maintenance) are segregated.  The Board certifies an annual budget and can reallocate funds.  The association may keep records (minutes, contracts, financials) accessible to members under Florida law (excluding privileged or private material).  Architectural and covenant rules enforcement is tracked per association policy, and all fines or enforcement actions are recorded.  In sum, the Plantation’s governance is vested in a Board accountable to owners, with a framework of bylaws, financial and enforcement policies, and amenity rules that together define members’ rights (to facilities and voting) and duties (to pay assessments and comply with restrictions).  A comprehensive consolidation of all documents was not available (e.g. the Declaration text could not be retrieved), so some specific details like fine schedules or ARC application requirements were beyond this summary’s scope.",
