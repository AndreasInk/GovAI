# Executive Summary

The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Beach is governed by a comprehensive set of documents (Articles of Incorporation, Declaration of Covenants, Bylaws, rules, enforcement and financial policies) that establish a not-for-profit community association and govern the rights, duties and restrictions of its members.  The corporate charter declares a perpetual non-profit corporation organized to operate and maintain the community, with each lot owner automatically a member of the association upon acquiring title.  Membership entitles owners to use common areas, vote (one vote per lot) in association matters, serve on the board or committees, and access corporate records within statutory limits.  By contrast, members must comply with all governing documents; pay regular assessments and any special assessments for community expenses; maintain their property (including landscaping and exterior structures) in good order; and obtain approval from the architectural review committee before any external modifications.

The governing instruments grant the association and its Board of Directors broad powers to manage community affairs, balanced by procedural constraints.  The Board is empowered to levy assessments, adopt and enforce rules, maintain and insure common areas (streets, drains, recreational facilities, landscaping, etc.), enter private lots (with notice) to correct violations or perform maintenance, and place liens for unpaid dues.  However, significant actions (such as amending covenants or incurring major special assessments) generally require member votes or supermajorities.  The documents set procedures for annual and special meetings of members (with required notices, quorums, voting and proxies), election of directors, and record-keeping.  They also provide for officer roles (President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc.), committees (e.g. for architectural control or landscaping), and require annual budgets and financial reports.

A central theme is preservation of community character and property values through covenants and restrictions.  The Declaration imposes use restrictions on each lot: properties must be used only for single-family residential purposes; homes and landscaping must meet specified aesthetic standards; nuisances (noise, odors, trash, unsightliness) are prohibited; and no structure, fence or exterior change is allowed without prior architectural committee approval.  Restrictions typically include limits on boat and RV parking, signs, pets, business activities, rental durations and exterior paint colors.  Owners must maintain their lots and drains, while the association maintains common elements.  Mutual easements ensure access for utilities, drainage and emergency ingress/egress.

Enforcement provisions outline remedies for violations: fines, suspension of common-area privileges, and liens for unpaid obligations.  Enforcement policies establish steps for violation notices, hearings before an architectural or standards committee, and appeals to the Board.  Financial policies govern fiscal operations: requiring timely assessment collections, setting interest and late fees on delinquencies, preparing annual budgets, maintaining reserves, conducting audits or reviews, and authorizing signatories.  In sum, the Plantation at Ponte Vedra Beach’s governing documents aim to balance individual member rights (use of property and amenities, voice in governance) with communal duties and restrictions designed to maintain the community’s standards, character and fiscal health.
