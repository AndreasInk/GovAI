  "The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Section: 4.1 Policy: Capital Expenditure Policy & Procedures Effective Date: 03/26/2013 Date Revised: 01/26/2016, 06/28/2022 SCOPE This policy provides guidelines for the development, review, approval and utilization of the Annual Capital Budget. It also provides for Emergency Capital Expenditures. REASON FOR THE POLICY To establish a sound process for the planning, authorization and expenditure of capital funds. PROCESS AND PROCEDURES A. The following process shall be followed in developing the Annual Capital Budget, which shall be defined as the expenditures for capital additions and repairs and replacements. 1) The Department Heads will prepare a list of capital needs for the coming year that details: a) A description of each proposed capital expenditure b) The estimated cost of each capital addition and repairs and replacement items c) The estimated month of each acquisition or expenditure d) The priority of the need relative to their other proposed capital expenditures e) Justification for each capital expenditure Any",
  "capital expenditure that amounts to $25,000 or more must have three competitive bids prior to acquisition. The Board of Directors must approve exceptions to this requirement. The Finance Committee shall, in accordance with its charter, oversee the preparation of the Annual Capital Budget. 2) The Department Heads will review their proposed capital expenditures with the General Manager prior to reviewing them with their respective Board Committees for any additions, deletions or other changes. 3) The General Manager and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) will consolidate the proposed capital expenditures into a total proposed Capital Budget. 4) The Finance Committee shall review the proposed Capital Budget for the coming year, making any suggested changes relative to need, timing, and the",
  "amount of funding available and provide recommendations to the Board of Directors. 5) The Board of Directors shall review the proposed Annual Capital Budget and make any appropriate changes. The Board of Directors shall then approve the Capital Budget for the coming year subject to the requirements contained in the Covenants (refer to notes (1) and (2)). 6) In addition to the requested departmental capital budgets, the Board of Directors will establish an annual $50,000 contingency fund in the Annual Capital Budget to cover emergency or unexpected needs. B. With the exception of the $50,000 contingency funding, no Capital Budget changes should be made without first identifying an approved capital budget item to be removed from the budget in order to provide funding for the new, suggested item. The item and the removal of the budgeted item must be reviewed by the General Manager and the Treasurer and approved by the Board of Directors. In the event that capital funds are required in excess of the approved capital budget total, the General Manager should generate",
  "a capital budget increase proposal for review with the Treasurer and approval by the Board of Directors. C. In the event of an emergency, the General Manager may initiate a capital expenditure with the prior approval of at least two Officers of the Association, as long as capital funds are available and as long as the expenditure meets the requirements of the Association’s Covenants. At a minimum, either the President or the Treasurer or their designee must approve the expenditure. Emergency capital funding should first come out of the $50,000 contingency fund. If the available contingency funding is inadequate to cover the emergency capital expenditure, the General Manager should either initiate a budget substitution or a capital budget increase proposal to cover and formalize the funding. Unanticipated capital expenditures not covered by the Annual Capital Budget funds shall be charged against the Reserve for Repair and Replacement of capital assets. D. All approved capital budget expenditures must be reviewed and confirmed by the CFO prior to commitment of the purchase. E.",
  "Once the capital item or project has been scheduled, it is the Board of Directors’ expectation that the final cost of the item will not significantly exceed the budgeted amount they had previously approved. The General Manager does have the discretion to spend more than the budgeted amount, without the approval of the Board of Directors, provided the final costs do not exceed the budgeted amount by more than 10%. Any expected item or project cost overruns in excess of 10% of the budgeted amount must receive the prior approval of the Board of Directors or, in the event of an emergency, of two Officers of the Association.",
  "These provisions require the Department Heads to closely monitor their capital expenditures and to anticipate and report potential cost overruns to the General Manager. F. The General Manager and CFO shall present a Capital Budget Status Report to the Finance Committee and the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. DEFINITIONS: 1. Capital Expenditures are defined as any project or asset acquisition, repair, replacement or alteration that has an aggregate cost of $2,000 or more and an expected life of three years or more. 2. A capital addition is defined as a new capital asset. 3. The total cost of a capital addition that is to be incurred over more than one fiscal year shall be budgeted and approved in the fiscal year in which the acquisition is first initiated. NOTES: 1) Covenants Article VII Section 2 (c) provides: “Any capital expenditure, other than repairs and replacements funded from a Reserve Account established as determined by the Reserve Study, which contains or constitutes addition to Association Real or",
  "Association Personal Property that, in any fiscal year, exceeds in the aggregate the sum of $250,000, as adjusted for the change in the Consumer Price Index for the then most recent available year as compared to the same index for the year 2009, shall be submitted for approval by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of Owners Entitled to Vote that are present, in person or by proxy, at a meeting at which a quorum has been attained”. 2) Covenants Article VII Section 9 (b) provides in part: … “The Board shall also adopt an Annual Capital Budget for the coming year which shall provide for the additions to the Association Property and for Repair and Replacement of Association Property...” and Section 6 (f) provides in part: “…Proceeds from Initiation Fees shall be used in the following order: …to purchase additional capitalized Association Property.”",

  "The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Section: 4.3 Policy: Reserve Accounts Date: 05/15/2004 Date Revised: 05/25/2010, 01/26/2016, 06/28/2022 Scope This policy describes the two reserve accounts as enumerated in the 7th Amended/Restated Declaration of Covenants and the policies of the Board of Directors and the Association in planning and managing these accounts. The two reserve accounts are spelled out in Covenants Article VII, Section 9 Budgets, (c) Reserves and are: • Reserve for Operating Contingencies; • Reserve for Repairs and Replacements of Capital Assets. Reason To establish a sound process for the recognition and management of the Reserve accounts. Reserve for Operating Contingencies This Reserve is established for two reasons and may be used at the discretion of the Board. The first reason is to cover short-term demands for cash to fund normal or unexpected operating expenses. The second reason is to provide contingency funding to cover any unexpected net operating loss, thus eliminating the need for a",
  "small member assessment for this purpose. If the Reserve for Operating Contingencies were insufficient to cover the operating loss, the membership may be assessed for the balance. The amount of this Reserve shall be an amount not to exceed 3% of the current year’s budgeted Gross Operating Revenue. The required amount is funded at the beginning of each year in the following order as needed: • From any balance remaining in this reserve account at the end of the preceding year. • From Net Income from Operations for the preceding year • From unapplied Initiation Fees from the preceding year. • From unapplied Initiation Fees from the current year. • From, and only to the extent necessary, an Interim Assessment. In the event that net operating income exceeds the amount needed to fund this Reserve in the following year, such excess is transferred to the Reserve for Capital Repairs and Replacements. Reserve for Repair and Replacement of Capital Assets This Reserve is established to fund the repair and replacement of existing capital assets. The",
  "balance of this Reserve will fluctuate over time since the need for capital funds for repairs and replacements varies significantly from year to year. In addition, this reserve may be used to fund expenditures for additions (new capital assets; see last paragraph of this Policy for details) This Reserve is funded from: • Capital Contributions from the Members in an amount determined annually by the Board of Directors and set forth in the Annual Capital Budget. • Interest Income",
  "• Unapplied Initiation Fees, but only after funding of Initiation Fee refunds, funding such other specific purposes for which an increase in the Initiation Fee was authorized and the funding of the Reserve for Operating Contingencies. • Net Income from Operations, but only after the Reserve for Operating Contingencies has been fully funded. Net Loss from Operations shall not be charged to this Reserve. During the annual budget process, it is imperative to forecast long-term capital requirements to ensure that this Reserve meets not only the demands for the current year, but also provides funding support for the capital needs over the following 20 years. Such needs shall be determined through the annual Reserve Study the starting point of which is based on the estimated life of all the Association’s capital assets and the estimated future replacement or repair cost of the same. The actual year of estimated repair or replacement can be moved up or delayed based on practical anticipated needs. Consideration for an Additions or New Capital Asset Expenditures Any capital expenditure which contains",
  "or constitutes an addition* which exceeds $250,000 in the aggregate, as adjusted for the change in the CPI index, in any fiscal year must be approved by 66 2/3% of Owners entitled to vote that are present, in person or by proxy, at a meeting at which a quorum has been attained. If approved by the Owners, and if there are sufficient funds in the Reserve, this expenditure may be funded out of the Reserve for Capital Repairs and Replacements. *A capital addition is defined as a new capital asset.",

PURPOSE To provide for the investment and protection of the Association’s cash funds. II. POLICY STATEMENT The investment of the Association’s cash funds shall be guided by the following objectives, listed in order of priority: Safety of principal: Investments shall be selected so as to preserve capital while maintaining liquidity. Liquidity and accessibility: Funds should be readily available for projected or unexpected expenditures with minimal associated costs. Return: Investments should earn the highest rate of return consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity requirements. III. CRITERIA The approved investments shall be limited to the following: U.S. Government Obligations U.S. Government Agency Obligations Fully FDIC-insured certificates of deposit in commercial banks IV. INVESTMENT AUTHORITY All investment actions, except as provided below in Section VI, require the approval of any two of the following",
  "authorities: Association Treasurer Association President Association CFO or General Manager (either/or, but not both) V. All investments shall be limited to a maximum effective duration of five (5) years. VI. PROCEDURE The Association CFO will monitor the Association’s cash assets on an ongoing basis and alert the Treasurer to the need to invest the Association’s excess cash funds. This assessment will be made in conjunction with upcoming and ongoing capital and operating expenditure requirements in order to determine the optimum investment amount and terms for the excess funds. The CFO and the Treasurer will identify qualified investments for the protection of the excess cash in accordance with the Association’s approved investment requirements, and",
  "will complete the acquisition of the investments. The investment transactions will be approved in accordance with the Association’s investment authorities. If an investment matures and the strategy is to continue with a similar instrument, the CFO has the discretion to make the investment with notice provided to the Treasurer when making a like-for-like investment replacement. The CFO will be responsible for the safekeeping of the investment documents in a secure location and ensure the funds are collected upon maturity. It is the responsibility of the CFO to ensure that we do not maintain cash in the Association’s bank accounts in excess of the FDIC-insured limits and that we do not invest in commercial bank CDs in excess of FDIC-insured limitations. In the event it becomes impossible to meet this requirement because of a financing, banking or other key business consideration, an exception to the requirement can be established with the prior approval of the Association's Board of Directors.

  "1 The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Section: 4.10 Policy: Facilities Improvement Plan Special Assessment Date: 05/23/2017 Date Revised: 06/28/2022 This policy addresses the Special Assessment approved by the members to cover the repayment of the loan that was made to partially fund the Facilities Improvement Plan (FIP). The FIP project included the renovation of the golf course, the improvements at the Beach House, and the addition of the Amenities Park and Croquet lawn. This policy pertains only to the funds that were borrowed from financial institutions ($5,460,100). The loan repayment is being financed through a Special Assessment of the membership to start January 1, 2017. Members will pay the assessment at $121 per month for 96 months, ending upon the retirement of the debt or December 31, 2024, depending on what occurs first. The funds received from the Special Assessment and the funds expended are to be accounted for as separate line item in the financial reports. Such funds received can",
  "be paid out only for the purpose of payment of principal and interest on the debt incurred to fund the improvements. New or existing members purchasing new property during the 96-month period starting January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2024, are required to pay the Special Assessment beginning on the closing date of the property purchase and ending upon the retirement of the debt or at the conclusion of the 96-month period, whichever occurs first. In the case of a property resale, the Special Assessment goes on uninterrupted and is assumed by the new owner. In May 2021, the Association offered an opportunity to prepay the remaining FIP Special Assessments in total, net of remaining interest. Sixty-four members took advantage of this offer. In most cases, the Special Assessment is not refundable; for example, if a member moves out of the Association, previously paid assessments are not refundable. The exception is if the ultimate payoff of the FIP loan is less than originally anticipated due to refinancing, those",
  "members who prepaid will receive a pro rata refund for any amount overpaid. The amount of the overpayment will be determined near the time when the payoff occurs which is expected to be Fall 2024.",
  "The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Section 4.12 Policy: Purchasing Policy for Operating Expense Contracts Date: 2003 Revised: 05/25/2010, 09/25/2018, 06/28/2022 This policy applies to purchases that are expensed in the Operating Budget such as fertilizer, merchandise and food. All purchases $10,000 and over must be approved by the General Manager prior to ordering. All purchases over $100,000 must be approved by an authorized executive officer of the Association (President, Vice President, Treasurer or Secretary of the Board of Directors). Repair and Maintenance invoices are reviewed and approved by the General Manager when reviewing weekly check runs. If an item shall be reclassified to capital or to another account, the Accounting team will process a reclassification. After the initial contract is approved by the General Manager and Board of Directors, recurring invoices do not have to be approved as received.",

  "The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Section 1.0 Policy: Organization and Management Date: 01/08/2007 Date Revised: 04/27/2021, 05/25/2021 The Board of Directors of the Association shall operate as a Board of oversight, policy development and strategic planning with the day to day management of operations executed by a professional staff reporting to a General Manager. The foregoing principle and policy shall be implemented by the adoption of the following policies and procedures: 1.1 General Manager: The most senior operating manager of the Association shall be the General Manager (the “GM”). The GM shall be accountable to the Board as the elected oversight body of the Association and will report to the Board through the President of the Association. 1.2 Association Officers: The President of the Association shall serve in a non- operating capacity as head of the Board and is charged with day-to-day liaison with the GM. The President shall also work with the GM to establish (a) operating priorities consistent with Board approved budgets and strategies, (b)",
  "Board agendas and (c) operational and financial reports to the Board. The President shall chair all meetings of the Board and all meetings of the Membership. The Vice President shall serve in the place of the President as necessary. The other officers of the Association shall be the Secretary of the Association, and the Treasurer. The By Laws describe the duties and responsibilities of the officers of the Association. 1.3 Committees/Member Selection: Committees play an important role in a community-based organization such as The Plantation by advising both the Board and the GM and by exercising specific independent authority granted by the Governing Documents. Committee activity provides a broad based source of information and feedback to management and the Board. At the same time, the involvement of a large number of residents in the governance and management process can lead to confusion, conflict and legal exposure, particularly when it comes to Association employees. Annually, each Committee Chair (or its Board Liaison where the Chair is a non-Board member) shall,",
  "in consultation with their fellow Board appointed committee member(s), recommend for Board approval such non-Board Association members, including but not limited to volunteers, who the Chair believes possess the background, skills, experience, personal qualities, availability and perspective that would make them beneficial contributing members to the committee’s stated mission, goals, duties and responsibilities. Each committee, other than the Human Resources Committee, shall consist of a majority of non-Board members. Committee membership selection and ultimate Board approval are each in the discretion of such Chairperson and the Board, respectively, and is not a matter of right. Committee members shall, subject to the Policy service requirements, serve at the pleasure of the Board until the next annual selection and approval process is completed. Committee vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as aforesaid. To clarify the role of committees in the various aspects of the Plantation’s governance and operations, their respective roles have been broken down into the following categories.",
  "1.3.1 Governing Committees: The Architectural Design Board, the Recruitment Committee, the Grievance Committee and the Executive Committee are each established by Governing Documents and/or Florida law. Each Governing Committee has specific authority to act. 1.3.2 Advisory Committees to the Board of Directors: The Bylaws provide that the Finance, Strategic Planning, Governance and Human Resources Committees shall be Advisory Committees to the Board. These Advisory Committees shall have specific charters approved by the Board and each shall have no fewer than two members of the Board as members. One of the committee members shall be appointed the Chairperson of each Committee by the President and approved as such by the Board. The Association’s Treasurer shall be the Chairman of the Finance Committee. The Human Resources Committee shall be advisory to the Board of Directors and its membership shall be consistent with Policy 1.8.11. 1.3.3 Advisory Committees to the General Manager: All committees other than Governing Committees and Advisory Committees",
  "of the Board shall be Advisory Committees to the GM. The role of these committees shall be strategic not operational. Committees will meet on a schedule developed and published by the Chair . The GM or his/her designee shall chair all the Advisory Committees to the GM. Membership on Advisory Committees to the GM shall be made up of members selected in accordance with Section 1.3 above. The Board shall establish parameters concerning committee size, term limits and multiple committee service. Members of the Board may serve as members of an Advisory Committee to the GM; however, to maximize the diversity of input to the GM there shall generally be no more than one Board member on each committee. Reports and/or recommendations of Advisory Committees to the GM shall be presented to the Board by the GM. 1.3.4 Executive Committee of the Board of Directors: Subject to the provisions of Florida Law with respect to notice and openness of meetings, the Executive Committee shall be empowered to act in the place",
  "and stead of the Board except that the Executive Committee may not- • Approve or recommend to Owners/Members actions or proposals required by law to be approved by Owners/Members • Fill vacancies on the Board of Directors or any Committee thereof • Adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Association • Terminate any officer of the Association • Approve disciplinary action against any Owner/Member • Adopt any material change to operating or capital budgets • Approve the appropriation of funds for the implementation of an item of capital expense in the approved capital budget except in the case of an emergency • Approve any increase in the Annual General Assessment",
  "The Executive Committee shall consist of the President, Treasurer and one non- officer of the Association. The Secretary shall serve ex officio and record minutes of the Committee. All actions, including those taken by unanimous written content, of the Executive Committee on behalf of the Board shall be reported to the full Board promptly, shall be submitted to the full for ratification at its next regular meeting, and such Executive Committee action and the Board ratification shall be noted in the Board minutes, it being understood that action of the Committee on behalf of the full Board authorizing commitments in good faith may not be reversed. 1.3.5 Required Non-Board Governing Committees: Governing Committees of the Association: Three Committees will operate autonomously from the Board. These Committees are Recruitment, Architectural Design and Grievance. Actions of these committees will be subject to appeal to the Board only in accordance with Governing Documents of the Association and Florida law. Membership on these Committees and their Charters shall be governed",
  "by the Association’s Governing Documents and Florida law. The Chairman of the ADB shall be appointed by the Board. Charters for these committees will be summarized in the Bylaws and full charters will be filed with the Bylaws. Summary charters for the ADB and Recruitment Committees appear in the Covenants and Bylaws respectively. 1.4 Committee Conduct: It is expected that all committee members conduct themselves in a courteous and respectful manner towards fellow committee members and Association employees. Committee work should be an inclusive process with respect for diversity of opinion. Once a committee has formally reached a decision, committee members should be willing to promote/explain decisions within the community. It is inappropriate for a committee member to undermine a decision or engage in any action or public debate that might frustrate its implementation. Committee members shall be respectful of Association employees and resources. Requests to have Association employees provide information or resources to the committee must first be presented to the Committee Chair. The Committee chair will",
  "review the request with the GM giving consideration to staff pressures and workloads and ensure that such requests do not impose unreasonable burdens on staff. Staff will be instructed not to accept requests from committee members that have not followed this process. Committee members that continually refuse to abide by committee conduct shall be subject to the following: First violation: Warning from the Chair Second violation: Letter from the Board of Directors Third violation: Removal from the Committee by the Board of Directors Particularly egregious conduct may result in immediate removal from the Committee.",

  "Plantation community and Realtors who have active listings shall be notified of the scheduled date of the event in advance so that proper planning can occur. Wherever possible, cooperative advertising should be coordinated by The Plantation and paid for by participating Realtors listing homes that are to be available for viewing.

Access Rules: Open House traffic shall exclusively use the Main Entrance on A1A for access.

The Committee shall vote to confirm or reject the Board’s proposed sanction(s). The Committee will act by vote of the majority. The Committee shall render its decision within 24 hours of the hearing unless it advises the Association and Member of extraordinary circumstances requiring more time or additional data gathering.
