  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 1 - SECTION I A. INTRODUCTION 1. ORIGINAL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY OF THE PLANTATION AT PONTE VEDRA, INC. While there is no certain theme or style of architecture defined for The Plantation, the design intent established by the developers is one of a simple elegance sympathetic with the environment and with other inhabitants and their structures within the community. The building policies defined in the next several pages are suggestions made in an attempt to define what materials, designs, and construction procedures will produce the optimum result for dollars spent by creating an atmosphere of continuity and harmony. If a theme can be ascribed to The Plantation, it has been taken from the architecture best defined as \"Picturesque\" timeless elegance sympathetic with the environment. Timeless or historically based styles are also encouraged. Diversity of styles or themes is encouraged giving the Plantation’s rich and varied fabric. It is The Plantation's intent that we not require strict adherence to a historical",
  "style, but that the building forms and elements be used to formulate a distinctive \"Plantation\" look. From these guidelines, the architect should be free to meet his client's needs through a resultant contemporary interpretation of historic form, material, and detailing which will provide for a community of cohesive identity. 2. OVERVIEW OF ADB GUIDELINES, POLICIES, RULES AND REGULATIONS These Guidelines and Policies reflect that The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc. is a privately owned equity club community with every purchaser immediately owning an interest in the club and common properties requirements set forth in the Declaration of Easements, Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions, and Limitations for The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc., as amended. The Architectural Design Board (ADB) section of this document sets forth the organization, authority, and administrative procedures for the ADB. These are intended to describe procedures in detail to assist owners in the design and construction of their residences. The ADB has been established to review and approve all plans",
  "for residences to be built in The Plantation and plans for additions/alterations to existing dwellings. The purpose of the Board, which administers aesthetic and environmental control over individual",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 2 - structures, is not to stifle design freedom or make design decisions but rather to ensure that the individual residences reflect the overall design objectives within an evolving community and that the unique natural setting is preserved and enhanced by a thorough review. The Architectural Design Board is available to each property owner to lend assistance during the design and construction of the lot owner’s residence. In addition, the ADB offers the following pre-planning services: 1. Explanation of service performed by the design disciplines: surveyors, architects and landscape architects. 2. Ecological information concerning tree and vegetation characteristics, their value and relationship to new construction. This consultation, if with the ADB landscape consultant, would occur at the member’s expense. 3. Information pertinent to The Plantation regulations. 4 . Pre-design conferences with the ADB Administrator, lot owner and/or ADB members if requested by the lot owner and discussions with the architect concerning a full range of considerations that should be given to the",
  "design of a particular residence on a specific lot. Such items to be discussed would include a) existing data on the lot; b) descriptions of adjacent and nearby homes either constructed, designed, or in process; c) advice on site views, vegetation, drainage, orientation of sun, lake level, utilities easement, and setbacks; d) construction techniques; e) exterior materials and colors; f) compatibility or potential conflict that may exist between owner's concept and the adjacent homes or community at large. This consultation, if with the ADB architectural consultant, would occur at the member’s expense. Each of t he ADB’s professional consultants is available to meet with the lot owner at the lot owner’s expense.",

  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 5 - SECTION II ADB PROCEDURES 1. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSE 1.1 Much effort was given to the master planning of The Plantation to ensure a thoughtful and harmonious development process. A major concern in the planning was the integration of development with its immediate environment. The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc. believes that man made improvements should, as much as possible, blend with nature rather than stand in stark contrast with it. The result is a development more pleasing to the eye and a more attractive community in which to live. 1.2 In order to assure that these objectives are achieved and to assure a continuity of physical development such that future development will be compatible with existing development, The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc. has declared and recorded amended Easements, Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions, and Limitations for The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc. Article VII of that Declaration establishes the Architectural Design Board and sets",
  "forth its jurisdiction, powers, obligations, and the rules and regulations under which it will conduct its review of proposed improvements. Any statements contained in this document are to condense, amplify, or clarify provisions of that declaration. In the event of a conflict, the declaration's provisions will prevail 1.3 Anyone applying for approval of the ADB for a home or project is urged to review carefully all provisions of the declaration prior to submitting an application to the committee. 1.4 The Architectural Design Board has been established for the purpose of defining aesthetic standards of construction in The Plantation and examining and approving or disapproving any and all proposed improvements for a building site within The Plantation. Improvements subject to review include but are not limited to: dwellings, garages, outbuildings or any other buildings, construction or installation of sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, mailboxes, decks, patios, courtyards, swimming pools, greenhouses, playhouses, awnings, walls, fences, exterior lights,",
  "any exterior addition to or change or alteration to existing structures, the painting or staining of any exterior surface, and landscaping of the property after improvements have been constructed or installed. The ADB reserves the right to require any unapproved outside element to include yard art to be removed. 1.5 Architectural Design Board approval must be obtained for shaping of land areas and drainage as well as removal of any trees more than 3\" in diameter, measured at breast height.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 6 - 2. ADMINISTRATION OF THE ADB 2.1 The Board of Directors of The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc., Inc. shall establish and appoint the members of the Architectural Design Board. The ADB shall consist of at least five (5) members who may or may not be members of the Board of Directors, but three of whom must be Parcel/Home Owners. 2.1.1 The regular term of office for each member shall be one year coinciding with the fiscal year of the Association. Any member appointed by the Board may be removed with or without cause by the Board at any time by written notice to such appointee and a successor or successors appointed to fill such vacancy shall serve the remainder of the term of the former member. 2.1.2 The Board of Directors shall appoint a Chairperson. The ADB shall elect a Vice Chairperson, who shall be the presiding officer at its meetings in the Chairperson’s absence. 2.2 Administrator: The ADB may appoint an administrator who",

The ADB is authorized to retain the services of consulting architects, landscape architects, urban designers, engineers, inspectors, and/or attorneys in order to advise and assist in the ADB in",
  "performing its functions set forth herein.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 7 - 2.4 The ADB in its general practice schedules meetings twice a month, on the first and third Tuesday of each month. The costs incurred by the arranging of additional ADB special meetings, including individual consulting by the ADB’s chairperson, architectural consultant or landscape consultant, may be billed to the party requesting these special meetings. Special ADB meetings are strongly discouraged. 3. PLAN SUBMISSION PROCEDURES 3.1 Four complete sets of all building plans (two for preliminary submission) and two sets of landscape plans must be submitted along with a completed application. 3.1.1 Plans must be submitted by 3:30 p.m. on the Tuesday prior to the scheduled meeting to allow the Board enough time for a thorough review.

  "be submitted to the ADB in order to determine suitability of a particular style or design for construction in The Plantation. The ADB will render an opinion as to whether or not a particular design would be acceptable. Because an artistic rendering is not always an accurate depiction of a design scheme, the ADB's opinion will be strictly non-binding and will be offered only in an effort to save an applicant's time and expense in pursuing a design that would be disapproved ultimately. 3.3 Preliminary Plans: 3.3.1 Preliminary plan submission is recommended highly and is used to resolve potential problems before going to the time and expense of final construction",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 8 - drawings. Each preliminary plan submitted will be given preliminary approval. Preliminary approval does not constitute approval for lot clearance or construction.

Per St. Johns County, no variance may be approved beyond four feet (4') on side or rear setbacks. The eight foot (8’) easement precludes",
  "the granting of a side variance in Garden Homes. (See Garden Homes, Section) b. The variance will not encroach over a property line;",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 10 - c. The variance is required due to one or more of the following; (1) To preserve a tree, bush, or shrub; or (2) To avoid an encroachment within an area designated as a wetland by the State of Florida or United States; or (3) Due to irregular or unusual lot shape, the proposed structure could not otherwise be constructed. Note: \"For aesthetic reasons\" is not an acceptable criterion to St. Johns County for the purpose of granting variances. However, accessory items such as air conditioning units, pools, pool enclosures, etc. are allowed over the setbacks if approved by the ADB. This means the ADB may approve for accessory structures to exist over the recommended setbacks. The ADB may choose to restrict all or some accessory structures to existing within the recommended setbacks due to its guidelines or general practices. The ADB guidelines allow for such flexibility with regards to its decisions including what would or would not be pleasing for aesthetic reasons.",

FOUNDATIONS: To provide a base or foundation for the residences of The Plantation, all finish floors will be a minimum of 18\" above finish grade and a minimum of 24\" above highest road crown elevation adjacent to the lot. While slabs on grade are prohibited visually, they may be accomplished through the use of stem walls with backfilling. Maximum height of finish floor above finished grade shall not exceed 5'-0\" unless required by Federal Flood Insurance Program. In the event a wood floor or crawl space is provided, the ventilation openings are to be covered with grating, wood louvers, or lattice painted to conform with the trim or color scheme of the homes. Standard aluminum vent grilles are not permitted. Any concrete block foundation walls are to be clad or stuccoed.

EXTERIOR WALLS: Acceptable exterior finishes include stucco, fiber cement siding (Hardie Board or equivalent) approved external coating systems, brick, stone, and cultured stone, limestone, coquina or coral block, or a combination of these materials. Concrete block must have a minimum of ½” of stucco finish. The traditional method of rustication, which by definition is the layering of a structure by the articulation of wall surfaces to become smoother in texture as they ascend the house in horizontal bands, is recommended. Veneer materials, such as coquina, must not stop on exterior corners. It is recommended that materials be wrapped around until it ends on an inside corner or architectural break in the structure. The Architectural Design Board permits the use of traditional brick. Queen size brick is not permitted. Samples of the brick and mortar must be submitted for approval. Use of other brick may also be approved when painted to match the approved color schemes. Board and",
  "batten, weathered wood siding, and cedar shake type materials are not allowed. Vinyl and aluminum siding are not allowed. Fiber cement siding materials may be permitted if such siding is cedar (or another wood) grain, is installed with a maximum 5 ¼” reveal, and is painted on site, following installation. Factory painted siding is not permitted. The synthetic aspect of fiber cement siding is diminished when it is applied in a context where horizontal siding would be expected architecturally, such as on homes of traditional design style. Characteristics that comprise traditional design include but are not limited to: overall symmetry, vertical window proportions, authentically applied shutters (each shutter is half the width of the window opening) simple hip or gable roofs, dormers, and a front porch element. The ADB will approve the use of fiber cement siding in this context only. Electricity is supplied by Beaches Energy Services. The following is the policy of the Beaches Energy Services: 1. Meter locations will be mounted along",
  "the sides of the houses within the first six feet of a front corner of the residence. 2. No fencing or other obstructions between the front corner and the meter location will be permitted. 3. Meter surrounds and conduit below must blend with exterior finish of home. 4. By calling telephone 904 -247-6258, a representative of Beaches Energy Services will visit the construction site and identify the meter location with the electrical sub-contractor prior to installation.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 24 - 6. WINDOWS AND DOORS: Areas with major fenestration or door and window openings shall be oriented to afford privacy while taking advantage of special views, such as lakes or fairways. Windows shall be carefully proportioned and located to enhance both the exterior appearance and interior light quality and views. It is recommended that all exterior doors that are not solid wood or metal and all windows be multi-light. Window and door frames are to have anodized aluminum, vinyl, or painted finishes. Natural color aluminum finishes are not allowed. The use of French doors in lieu of sliding glass doors is highly recommended. No sliding glass doors are to be visible from the main or side streets. It is recommended that houses not have openings (doors and windows) which total more than 35% of the exterior wall area. All residences, whatever the percentage, shall conform to the Florida Energy Code requirements. While tinted glass (gray in color only) is acceptable, no foil or reflective",
  "material shall be used on any windows for sunscreens. Roof overhangs, awnings, and shutters are appropriate sunscreening devices with approval of design and color. Where more than one window treatment is viewed from a single or adjacent elevations, drapery liners must be used to provide consistent appearance. 7. ROOFS: The roofs of all houses within The Plantation, while perhaps different in material and color, shall have a similarity of form to provide for the homogeneous character with all gable and hip roofs having a minimum overall roof slope of 8/12. While 8/12 is the recommended slope, other slopes will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Flat ceramic or cement roofing tiles are recommended. Slate and barrel tile in ceramics may be permitted. Engineered composite slate or shake shingles may be permitted if approved by the ADB.(Examples are products by Lamarite and CertainTeed Symphony Luxury Shingles or equal products as approved by the ADB . Wood shingles and cedar shake are not allowed. Composition shingles",
  "and standing seam metal roofs are not allowed. Flat roofing pitch is acceptable only in minor areas (not to exceed 15% of roofing area) with primary acceptability in use as a connection to more dominant themes of the roofing mass. All connecting roofs, i.e. garage to main structure or freestanding garage, pool enclosures, and etc. shall have a roof with material similar to that of the main structure. Roof overhangs form a very integral part of the architectural character of The Plantation and should be maximized wherever possible to shelter from both the subtropical sun and rain showers. While in many cases the roof overhangs can incorporate balconies, decks, and screened porches, the minimum depth shall be 1' – 6\" with gable ends of 1' – 0\". The more contemporary shed construction is not appropriate to The Plantation. Eaves and roofs should not extend over the property line. Roof attachments, whether ornamental or functional such as lightning rods, ornamental ridge caps, weather vanes, oversized fireplace",
  "flues, observation towers, and etc. are not only permissible but encouraged to give an additional scale of detail to the dwellings. Those items shall have specific approval by the ADB.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 25 - All roof accessories such as vent stacks and roof vents shall either be painted to match the roof color or accentuated to form a statement. Wherever possible, vents shall be located away from the entry elevations. Flashing shall be copper (or metal flashing painted to match) except in a case where good construction practice demands other materials. No raw aluminum or galvanized flashing is allowed where it is visible. The use of solar energy producing devices (active and/or passive) is subject to ADB approval.

CHIMNEYS: In the style of architecture envisioned for The Plantation, chimneys, along with the other projections above roofing surfaces, play a dominant role in depicting the character desired. Chimney dimensions shall be compatible in scale to the structure; however, the minimum size shall be 2' – 6\" x 4' – 6\". All exposed surfaces of chimneys shall be of masonry or stucco with a preference for covered flue endings. Prefab metal fireplaces are acceptable within a residence; however, the exposed metal flue must be totally covered with approved materials. No prefabricated metal spark arrestors or flue tops may be exposed to view. Direct vent gas fireplaces are allowed, but exterior vent location shall be screened from view from street and golf course. 9. OUTBUILDINGS AND GARAGES: Any outbuilding permitted on a lot, such as pool houses or detached garages, must be compatible within the main house in style as well as materials and color.",

Garage doors shall not open to the street or impact on adjacent properties' privacy. Front-facing garages are not allowed in Units I – VIII and X. 10. POOL FENCES Pool enclosures are permissible so long as their form is similar to that of the main house and do not appear as added appendages. This can be easily accomplished by utilizing roof or screen slopes similar to the house and not of a different slope. It is recommended that they be extensions of the house form rather than add-ons, with elements of the house, e.g. stucco walls, and etc. built into the structure.",
  "Aluminum members shall be of a size to demonstrate visual stability and shall be painted or anodized to approved colors. Bronze or black aluminum is encouraged.

  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 28 - 1. Pool fencing must meet St. Johns County Code. 2. Pool fencing must have a self-closing and latching gate. 3. Pool fence color is to be black or dark green. Colors other than black must be specifically approved by the ADB. 4. A specific style of pool fence has been approved by the ADB for The Plantation. Cut sheets of the specific pool fence design which may be utilized must be submitted for review (see illustration below). 5. Pool fences are to follow the general contour of the deck and be no more than five feet from the deck, which will allow for landscaping when desired. A resident may fence the pool but may not fence the yard. 6. Pool fencing must be shown on architectural site plans as well as landscape plans. 7. Appropriate landscape materials must be shown on the landscape plan with regard to softening pool fencing. With regard to existing pools, the ADB will approve the installation of either an enclosure or",

Minimum Required Fencing; Permitted Fencing:",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 29 - 11. COLORS In addition to the form and massing of a structure, the color is perhaps the single most dominant visual expression to a building. In general, the theme will be to blend with rather than dominate the environment which includes not only the topography and vegetation but also those structures which are in the immediate proximity. Colors are to be submitted for approval. A given residence and its associated outbuildings and walls shall use not more than three colors, excluding the roof color provided that the roofing color is in a neutral range. All color selections must be submitted in sample form at the time of submission to the Board. Color samples are to be submitted for the ADB files on. 2” by 3” minimum color chips. In addition, new house submissions are to include samples of colors for body and trim to be painted side by side on a pre-cut 2’ x 4’, 3/8” thick plywood board. Such boards are readily available at Home Depot. The trim color",
  "is to be painted 4” wide down the entire 4’ length of the left side of the board and the body color is to be painted adjacent (both colors touching with no space in between)to the trim and cover the rest of the entire plywood board. Existing houses submitting color changes are to submit color samples for the AD B files on 2” by 3” minimum color chips. In addition color change submissions must include the same painted plywood 2’ x 4’ color sample described above or the Owner may paint a 2’ x 4’ body/trim sample swatch on their existing home for review. 12. SERVICE AREAS Every house must have a service area for trash receptacles, utility meters, HVAC equipment, pool equipment, fuel tanks, and materials, supplies, and equipment to be stored outside. The service areas are to be screened from view from Association property and adjacent properties by a permanent structural wall at least 4 feet high, which is to be made of the same material as that of the house approved by",
  "the Architectural Design Board. Such service area barriers (walls) are to appear to be extensions of the house. Service areas for trash need to be close to the front of the home to allow rubbish collection within service area by vendor. Material is to be consistent with color and materials used on the house. Chain link fencing is not allowed. It is recommended that interiors of service courts be paved with a hard surface material. 13. PARKING A minimum of two in-garage parking spaces must be provided for each residence. Additional guest parking, screened by landscaping, space is also recommended with either turn-around or backup areas (side entry garages must have a minimum 24’ of backup) being provided to preclude backing onto the streets, which is prohibited. Except for Garden Homes, garage doors must face away from the street.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 30 - Driveways must be paved with a hard surface such as concrete, concrete or brick pavers, brick, or exposed aggregate, etc. In the event concrete is to be colored, the color scheme is to be approved. All drives must average at least 5' from and be no closer than 3’ to the adjacent property lines to allow for landscape material. 14. BASKETBALL GOALS Portable basketball goals are prohibited. Permanent basketball goals are permitted, provided the following procedures are followed: A. If ground-mounted, the support post and attachments must be painted either Hunter Green or Black. B. If house-mounted, the backboard must be attached to the garage area of the house, with attachment supports painted the color of the house fascia/soffits. C. The backboard must be made of clear plastic. D. The location of the installation must be made as far away from the street as possible and practical and is subject to the approval of the ADB. 15. SATELLITE DISH",
  "ANTENNAE Out of consideration for your neighbors and others in the community, the ADB requests that satellite dishes be installed on or near the ground and be screened with landscaping. 16. PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT Background: The Plantation’s Rules and Regulations provide that “Permanent swing sets and permanent play units are permitted subject to approval by the ADB” and “Tree swings and trampolines are permissible provided they are approved by the ADB and meet the landscaping and screening requirements.” The ADB has never established any policies or standards relating to these two existing community rules, however, so there are no guidelines to determine what is approvable or to assist Members in planning proposed improvements to their Parcel. In preparing the guidelines set forth below, the ADB has attempted to balance its desire to preserve and protect the community’s aesthetics and the “premier golf experience” at the Plantation while also allowing Members to utilize their property in accordance with the Rules and Regulations. Comparable Guidelines: While not directly comparable,",
  "the most useful comparison of existing guidelines used by the ADB is the one for swimming pools since pools and pool enclosures can adversely impact the aesthetics of the community and the golf course with a similar type of noise and visual clutter. The current pool placement guidelines are as follows: (1) the pool must be set back ten (10) feet from the rear and side property lines, (2) a fence at 10’ or a fence or screened enclosure at 20’ must surround the pool in accordance with building codes, and (3) low landscaping must be planted around the majority of the fence or enclosure’s perimeter. The low landscaping preserves the views of the homeowner but also allows views of the pool and patio area from the golf course, common area or adjoining parcels. The standards are the same for pools throughout the community without distinction between those lots that adjoin the golf course and those that have more secluded back yards. Occasionally, in special circumstances,",
  "exceptions that allow reductions in",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 31 - setbacks are made to the requirements although those exceptions are typically made for secluded perimeter areas or for garden homes where the pool would be completely enclosed by a privacy wall. Approved Guidelines: The ADB’s approval of permanent outdoor play equipment, including trampolines, swing sets and play structures shall be approvable on a case-by-case basis taking into account the equipment’s visibility from the golf course and other Association Property, subject to the following guidelines: Setbacks – Ten (10) feet from the rear and side property lines. If the proposed location is adjacent to the golf course there shall be an additional requirement that the equipment be at least (a) seventy five (75) feet from a cart path, (b) seventy five (75) feet from any fairway and (c) 150 feet from any tee or green. [All distances apply] Colors and Materials – Wood finished to a dark brown or gray color (or allowed to naturally weather) and composites that look like wood are the preferred",
  "materials. Any metal, plastic or canvas components shall be green or a dark color. Other colors or materials may be considered as an exception in circumstances where the equipment is in a secluded location and not visible from the golf course or other Association Property. Height – The highest point on the equipment shall be not greater than ten (10) feet. Screening – Equipment must be substantially screened from view from adjoining Parcels, rear property lines, from the golf course and from other Association Property. Screening shall be dense evergreen landscaping materials with an initial height to be specified by the ADB at the time of approval. Required Approval Condition: Our Covenants provide that “… [Owners] shall be obligated to refrain from any actions which would detract from the playing qualities of the golf course.” Therefore, any equipment approved by the ADB shall be further subject to a condition whereby the equipment shall be removed upon written notice from the Board of Directors due to violations of the Covenants.",

The submission should include a site plan and bulkhead cross-section drawings prepared by an architect/engineer/licensed contractor showing the property lines, water and proposed bulkhead location A. The plan must show the point of penetration and the cap elevation. Reference “Pond Bulkheading typical Cross -Section” page. Note: Some calculations and heights of bulkheads to be allowed are different for different lakes. B. The plan must show bulkhead returns at each end that are parallel to the lot’s side property lines. C. Bulkhead design (aesthetics) is to be consistent with existing current wooden bulkheads at The Plantation. c. An owner may reestablish his original lake bank. This point will be reviewed/determined",

The design criteria are four-to-one from top of the bank to the original water’s edge. Step Two – Preparation/In-Field Inspection: a. Once site plan and bulkhead cross-section drawings have been reviewed and approved by the ADB, an owner may move forward to prepare the area as approved. The area is to be staked and finish grade is to be established by a registered surveyor in accordance with the approved plan. b. When the area has been prepared as described above, the ADB Administrator is to be contacted and he or his designee shall perform an in-field inspection prior to commencement of construction. Step Three – As-Built Survey: a. After construction is completed, an as-built survey confirming the bulkhead has been placed and constructed in accordance with the ADB approved plan must be submitted to the ADB. Upon receiving and reviewing the",
  "as-built survey, the owner will receive an inspection letter from the ADB indicating final approval or detailing those steps which must be taken to obtain final approval. b.

GARDEN HOME SITES DEFINED: Residential lots shown on recorded plats and on which the location of a patio wall or building wall is designated are referred to as \"Garden Home Sites\". 2. GARDEN HOME DEFINED: A garden home refers to a single-family detached dwelling unit consisting of one or more courtyards partially or completely surrounded by enclosed living areas and/or privacy walls. Dwelling units constructed on Garden Home Sites must be constructed so as to utilize a patio wall as designated on the recorded subdivision plat. The dwelling unit shall utilize a portion of the patio wall as one of its exterior walls unless an alternative location of the dwelling is approved based on existing natural features (see figure 3). Alternative locations shall be considered on an individual basis, based on the sole discretion of the Architectural Design Board. 3. GARDEN HOME CONCEPT: The Garden Home",
  "emphasizes an indoor/outdoor use relationship and full utilization of the site for living purposes addressing the following: 1. Visual and acoustical privacy. 2. Division of public/private areas. 3. Sensitivity in response to views, breezes, sun, existing vegetation, and thoughtful and thorough landscape design. 4. Interior and exterior spatial volumes and sequences. 4. SIZE OF GARDEN HOME AND LOT COVERAGE: All Garden Homes in Units A, B, C and Surrey Lane shall have between 1,800 and of 4,350 square feet of enclosed dwelling area. In two-story Garden Homes, the second floor maximum size is either 1,450 sq. ft. or half of the first floor (air conditioned) square footage, whichever is less.

The total of both floors shall not exceed 4,350 square feet (air conditioned). The ADB prefers the second floor of Garden Homes to be constructed towards the center of the house, keeping a single story profile on either side. (See Preferred Plan & Elevations). When this is not possible, the ADB will restrict the amount of the home that is two-story* on either side. On the two foot setback side, the maximum amount of the home that can be two-story is 30% of the building length. On the eight foot setback side, the maximum amount of the home that can be two-story is 70% of the building length.",
  "(See allowed Plan & Elevations) A 90-foot long house, for example, could only have 27 feet of two-story along the two foot setback side and 63 feet of two-story along the eight foot setback side. * Because it is the intent of the ADB to reduce the overall massing, two- story is defined as a plate height greater than 12 feet 6 inches above finish floor (a.f.f.). This applies to bonus rooms over garages. However, the 12 foot six inch height is measured from the finish floor of the home and not the garage floor. The only exception to the 70%/30% two-story limitation is if the two-story portion of the home has a greater side setback. The increased setback is determined by the height. This applies to anything above 12 feet six inches (a.f.f.). Each additional foot of height above 12 feet six inches must be set back an additional foot along the entire side setback line. If, for example, the plate height of the home is 21’6” and it exceeds",
  "the maximum allowable percentage described above, the new side setback would be: 2’ Setback Side 8’ Setback Side 21’6” actual height 21’6” actual height - 12’6” allowed height -12’6” allowed height 9’0” additional setback 9’0” additional setback +2’0” existing setback +8’0” existing setback 11’0” new side setback 17’0” new side setback * Addendum effective May 26, 1999 5. HEIGHT OF GARDEN HOMES: To maintain the scale of the neighborhood of Garden Homes, height will be restricted to two floors of enclosed living space as in figure 1. Maximum height is 35 feet.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 36 - This limitation will allow for sloping rooflines (8/12) and flexibility in architectural expression, i.e. organization and spatial relationships. If a two story scheme is pursued, attention should be given to minimize impact and deal sensitively to potential adjacent one story structures. Figure 1 below depicts a desirable approach to this problem incorporating second story space predominantly within roof form. NOTE: Finish floor to be established at a minimum of 2'-0\" ab ove crown of road. 6. PLACEMENT OF GARDEN HOME ON LOT: Setback restrictions affecting Garden Home lots at the Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc. are as follows: 1. Patio wall must be built between two (2) feet and three and one half (3.5) feet inside and parallel to the side property line, unless Option B is exercised. 2. The minimum side yard setback is eight (8) feet inside and parallel to the property line farthest from the patio wall. 3.",
  "Front setback for all permanent structures including privacy wall must be maintained at twenty-five (25) feet for Garden Home Section A and twenty (20) feet for Garden Home Section B, C, and Tennis Center inside and parallel to the front property line. 4. Rear setback must be maintained at twenty (20) feet for Garden Home Section A and seventeen and one half (17 ½) feet for Garden Home Section B, C, and Tennis Center inside and parallel to the rear lot line. Projection into this area along lake and golf course with terraces, seating walls etc., not to exceed 30\" in height, is discouraged but may be considered in some circumstances. 5. Second floor windows must be placed so as not to view into and over courtyard walls of adjacent homes. 6. With the exception of high transoms, approved obscure glass block and overhangs which may not exist over the property line, when approved by the ADB, there shall be nothing on the 2’ side of a Garden Home:",
  "no service areas, windows, grills, doors, etc. 7. The area included within these setbacks is the buildable area. All enclosed dwelling areas and areas impervious to weather of the Garden Home must be contained within the buildable area. 8. The Garden Home is to be designed to its site. When passing on the acceptability of a Garden Home, the Architectural Design Board will consider plans submitted for Garden Homes on lots on either side of the plan under review.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 37 - 7. LOCATION OF PATIO WALL: Two options exist in locating a patio wall on a Garden Home lot: 1. Option A The patio wall shall be constructed simultaneously with a garden home and shall be located so that the exterior of the same shall be located two (2) feet inside of and parallel to the designated lot line on the recorded subdivision plat. There shall be reserved a two-foot easement of each lot between the exterior of the patio wall and/or dwelling unit and the parallel lot boundary line for the use and enjoyment of the adjacent lot owner, as provided in the Covenants. Said two-foot easement area and the exterior of the patio wall and/or dwelling unit may be used by an adjacent lot owner for the planting and care of shrubbery and other landscaping, providing the same does not interfere with the structural integrity of the patio wall and/or dwelling unit. Roof overhangs are not permitted over the",
  "2’ side property line. An eight-foot easement is granted to the adjoining lot owner along the boundary line of each lot which is opposite the boundary line along which the patio wall is to be constructed for the construction, maintenance, and repair of the patio wall and/or dwelling unit on the adjoining lot. The use of said easement area by the adjoining lot owner shall not exceed a reasonable period of time during construction nor shall it exceed a period of thirty (30) days each year for essential maintenance. Any shrubbery or planting in the eight (8) foot easement area that is removed or damaged by the adjoining lot owner during the construction, maintenance, or repair of his patio wall and/or dwelling unit, shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the said adjoining lot owner causing such damages. See Figure 3. 2. Option B Should an owner of a patio lot desire to locate his garden home on a portion of the lot other than contiguous to the patio wall, he",
  "may apply to the Architectural Design Board for approval of the alternative location. A site plan showing the proposed alternative location is required. The Architectural Design Board's approval of the alternative location shall not relieve the owner's responsibility to construct and maintain a privacy wall on the line designated for the patio wall. See Figure 3b, Option A. That owner's unit, however, must not have a view into the adjoining Garden Home lot from any windows. This may require windowless walls on the second story of the unit to ensure privacy to the neighboring patio lot. Obscure glass block and/or high transom windows may be utilized if approved by the Architectural Design Board. Approval or disapproval of an application for alternative location of a Garden Home may be based by the Architectural Design Board on purely aesthetic or contextual considerations.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 38 - 8. CHARACTER OF THE PATIO WALL: A patio wall must form an integral part of the side wall of the house unless Option B is exercised and shall turn to form a courtyard privacy wall. The patio privacy walls should not be merely a \"fence\" but part of a courtyard enclosure. Approved walls shall appear to be an extension of the architecture of the structure. A long wall that ends abruptly at the setback line will not be allowed. It is visually unsettling and not in the spirit of a patio house which is to enclose outdoor space for use as an extension of the living area. See Figure 4. The patio wall at the rear should not necessarily turn because then it will block amenity views of the golf course or lake. However, the owner will be allowed to enclose his property if in an interior lot condition. Unobstructed view across a neighboring lot is not guaranteed to a Garden Home lot owner. 9. EXTENT",
  "OF THE PATIO WALL: That portion of the patio wall that extends beyond the enclosing walls of the house shall extend no closer than twenty (20) feet to the rear lot line and twenty-five (25) feet to the front lot line in Garden Home Section A; no closer than seventeen and a half (17.5) feet to the rear lot line and twenty (20) feet to the front lot line in Garden Home Sections B, C, and Tennis Center. The extent of the wing wall depends on the location of the house on the site. It must ensure sideyard privacy to the adjoining lot owner. See Figure 5. Because house in 5b is sited closer to the road than its neighbor, no patio wall extension is needed in front to successfully screen adjoining neighbor's side yard. Rear patio wall does not extend to rear setback. 10. HEIGHT AND MATERIAL OF THE PATIO WALL: To provide visual and acoustical privacy between homes, height of the patio wall shall be a minimum of 6'",
  "– 0\" above finished floor of the unit, not to exceed 8' – 0\" and of predominantly the same material as that portion of the patio wall that is the exterior wall of the house. Where the wall turns, it is permissible to introduce another screening material. Acceptability of such a fence or screening material will be decided upon by the Architectural Design Board to ensure that it is consistent with good design principles and the overall character of the house and neighborhood.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 39 - A good solution is one that sensitively combines only two materials in a solid-void relationship. 11. TEMPORARY PRIVACY WALL: If a neighboring patio lot is vacant and if privacy is desired, a temporary fence erected along the property line will be permitted, subject to approval of the Architectural Design Board. Cost of said fence will be borne by the lot owner erecting the fence. This fence must be removed when the patio wall is constructed on the adjacent lot. 12. USE OF EXTERIOR SPACE IN GARDEN HOMES: 1. Front Yard: The patio wall extending toward the front twenty-five (25) foot setback requirement shall turn to form one or more private or semi-private outdoor enclosures to be used as a service court to enclose HVAC equipment, meters, and refuse. A minimum of two on-site parking spaces must be provided but no more than two spaces are allowed within the twenty-five (25) foot front setback area. See Figure",
  "7a. 2. Side Yards: In keeping with the concept of a Garden Home, side yards should be treated as outdoor living extensions of the house itself and not simply as storage or unusable space typical of traditional side yards. Service and equipment courts may be incorporated in this area also but may not encroach in setbacks. 3. Rear Yard (when not on golf course or lake): Where a rear yard is not adjacent to a lake or a golf course fairway, an enclosing wall will extend to and along the rear property line irrespective of the twenty (20) foot setback requirement to allow the owner the maximum use of his property in the instance of interior lots only. Each property owner will be required to construct the privacy wall which is an extension of the patio wall to the rear property line and approximately one-half the distance along the rear property line, to a point determined by the Architectural Review Board. Color and material of the wall are to be approved by the ADB. 4. Other:",
  "a. Service areas must be screened by a permanent structural wall to match the color and materials of the home and must be a minimum 4' in height or higher if necessary to screen trash receptacles, service equipment, etc. from view. The screen wall is to be screened with landscape materials.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 40 - b. Gas containers must be in screened service areas or be buried per St. Johns County code. c. Irrigation clocks must be installed outside (preferably in the service area) and be suitable for exterior use. 13. MAINTENANCE OF PRIVACY: To facilitate privacy to the neighboring lot, the dwelling unit shall be constructed so that neither the patio wall nor the dwelling unit provides any window or vie w openings looking into or over viewing the adjacent lot and provides no access way or entryway into said adjacent lot. In a two-story Garden Home, particular attention must be given to potential vision from decks and/or windows into and over adjacent lots or patios. 14. CHARACTER OF PLANTATION GARDEN HOMES: The desire of the Plantation is to create a unique garden home community within the context of \"the architectural guidelines\" as adopted by the Plantation. The Plantation, in the garden home concept, is encouraging both continuity",
  "and attention to context due to close proximity of homes and individuality to prevent the appearance of a \"monolithic project\". In achieving continuity, such items as roofing material, roof pitch, and brick veneer shall be consistent. Variations in color, organization, screen wall detailing, louver detailing, chimney detailing, window and door organization, trellis detail, etc. are the types of elements in which individuality can be achieved and will be encouraged. More specifically, the elements of continuity will be as follows: Roof pitch – to be 8/12. Roofing material and color to be approved by Architectural Design Board. Brick and stone veneer – smooth brick with concave joints to be painted in color to be approved by Architectural Design Board is the most desirable approach. The Board is encouraging the use of different bonds to accentuate elements such as frieze, cap of wall, expression of floor slab, sills, and chimney. Natural brick will be considered; however, a brick sample must be submitted to the",
  "Architectural Design Board along with proposed mortar color to receive con sideration. Extreme blends, extremely light, or dark brick should be avoided. Siding – Wood shingles and cedar shake shingles are not allowed. Approved cementious siding is permitted. As with other single family homes at the Plantation, sensitivity to landscape design is a must and will be reviewed by the Architectural Design Board with the same scrutiny as the architectural elements. With the Garden Home concept, even more",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 41 - critically, landscape and site development are essential to the success or failure of the individual scheme and the overall ambience of the community. 15. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS: No permanent structures shall be constructed in the eight (8) foot side easement to allow access for maintenance of the patio wall on the adjacent lot. However, approved trellises and/or landscaping will be permitted in the easement. The cost of construction, maintenance, and repair of a patio wall shall be the sole responsibility of the lot owner on whose lot the same is situated. Every effort should be made to preserve natural vegetation and to fully utilize existing topographic amenities. 16. SPECIAL DESIGNATED GARDEN HOME LOT LANDSCAPING: See Landscape section of Architectural Guidelines for landscaping information. An Architectural Design Board approved landscape installation plan has been developed and is required for lots 12 through 20, Surrey Lane (see attached plan for Lots 12 and 17 as an example. The second page is a tree",
  "survey for all relevant lot lines). 17. EXAMPLES OF GARDEN HOME PLANS AND ELEVATIONS: In the Appendix of Sample Garden Home Plans and Elevations (Section VII, below), there are a number of sample drawings, plans and elevations that may assist in the design of garden homes.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 42 - SECTION V LANDSCAPING 1. INTRODUCTION: Just as there is no specific architectural theme for house design in The Plantation, there is no rigid prescription for the treatment of grounds of each home. However, the treatment of the home site should be a logical and interesting extension of the architectural expression of the home. The plans for the house and lot should evolve together. The materials and spatial definitions should be relevant to the natural site conditions and the proposed use of outdoor areas. The feeling of a \"natural\" environment in the use of plant material is encouraged as opposed to a heavily manicured theme. 2. PURPOSE: It shall be the principal purpose of these regulations and criteria to: 1. Assure that all structures, facilities, and objects constructed, developed, and/or installed on a temporary or permanent basis within The Plantation development and property contiguous thereto under the control or jurisdiction of The Plantation are accommodated with landscape plantings and the various elements of",
  "landscaping that reflect the prestigious and unique character of the community and the surroundings therein; and, 2. Assure that property and community values are enhanced and perpetuated through the use of site plantings, foundation area plantings, screen plantings, accent plantings, lake bank treatments, golf course frontage treatments, and driveway and street plantings through the use of fountains, trees, shrubs, grass, permitted decorative privacy walls or fences, earth berms/mounds, bridges, paths, statuary, and other such elements as may be acceptable to the Architectural Design Board; and, 3. Assure that existing trees and other native plant materials are preserved, enhanced, and incorporated into the landscape development area; and, 4. Assure that positive drainage and other designed and natural features of the development and the area(s) to be landscaped are maintained and preserved as required. 3. INTENT: It is intended that all builders, developers, designers, homeowners, and construction contractors who engage in any type of construction and development activity",
  "comply with these regulations. 4. JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY: The Architectural Design Board of The Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc. shall be the jurisdictional authority for the administration, implementation, revision, promulgation, and enforcement of the landscape development regulations and criteria. 5. ENFORCEMENT: In addition to the Architectural Design Board's ability to enforce these regulations and criteria as an exercise of the Board's constitution in the Declaration of Easements, Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions and Limitations for The Plantation at",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 43 - Ponte Vedra, Inc., as amended, the Board may undertake any other enforcement actions and measures that are reasonable and effective. 6. EXCEPTIONS AND WAIVERS: When in the sole discretion of the Architectural Design Board substantial justification exists, exceptions and waivers may be granted. Such exceptions and waivers as may be granted shall not be construed to constitute a precedent or to abrogate any of the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Architectural Design Board. 7. DEFINITIONS: 1. Landscape Plans: A set of drawings to scale indicating both existing and proposed landscape elements to be constructed on the site. They shall include trees, shrubs, ground covers, sod and mulch areas, lighting, hardscape elements such as arbors, gazebos, pools, fountains, patios, sun porches, screened enclosures, outdoor kitchens and any other items that may enhance the design of the site.

The cultivated varieties acceptable for use are “Captiva”, a semi-dwarfed, slower growing turf grass resistant to chinch bugs that grows with as little as 4 hours of direct sunlight and requires less water use to sustain; and “Sapphire”, a soft and luxurious turf grass with excellent wear ability. Due to poor",
  "insect and cold resistance; “Floratam” is no longer recommended. In heavier shade conditions, “Classic” may be specified as an acceptable St. Augustine variety. b. Ground Cover: Low growing or ground hugging plants of a vine or bunch character which is planted sufficiently close to form a uniform cover over the ground area devoted to such planting. Most plants classified as ground covers for the purposes of these regulations and criteria will attain mature heights of twelve (12\") inches or less. c. Shrub: A woody self-supporting evergreen or deciduous plant that may or may not produce conspicuous flowers and which attains a mature height of twelve (12\") inches or greater. d.

The minimum depth of the plant bed from the adjacent building wall shall not be less than three-quarters of the single story wall height measured from foundation grade to eave of the roof. The widest areas of the foundation plant bed shall not be greater than one and one-half times the single story wall height measured from foundation grade to eave of the roof. Where space is restricted in patio or garden home areas, plant bed depths shall be",
  "adjusted to the limits of the area while passage is maintained for service and safety. Where foundation plant beds must be restricted in depth, the use of plants and other elements that provide accent or substance of a compensating nature shall be used. If, for example, the height of the planting shall not exceed three (3') feet except for individually planted accent plants that shall not exceed two -thirds of the building wall height that is the backdrop for the planting. In all instances of developing plantings around the foundation area of the building, careful consideration shall be given to the bed depth to building height relationship in order to appropriately mass and accent focal locations. 2. Plantings surrounding the perimeter of the lot: Trees, shrubs and vines should be designed with diversity in mind as to planting. Linear privacy hedges are discouraged. Natural drifts of plants are encouraged and enhance the natural surroundings of the community. Care should be taken not to adversely affect these elements and to preserve",
  "the character and sense of place of the community. Plantings should accentuate positive views, i.e. natural amenities of the Plantation; naturalized areas of woodlands, protected wetlands and upland buffers, the golf course and amenity centers, the waterways and the adjacent homes within the community and screen negative ones. 3. Plant selection: a. Plants can become susceptible to disease. Some can require excessive chemical treatment. Problems with insect control are common to Dwarf Burford Holly, King Sago Palms and Coontie Palms, Oleanders, Cannas and to a lesser degree Azaleas and Camellias. Problems with fungi and leaf spot are common to Indian Hawthorn, turfgrass, Impatiens and to a lesser degree Ligustrum. Invasive species include Lantanas, Wax Myrtles, Bamboos, Rice Paper Plants and to a lesser degree Ferns, Periwinkles and Impatiens.",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 50 - b. Landscaping shall be created with due consideration of the image of the community and when possible respect the need to reduce high water use. See Appendix I for mean canopy spread and spacing guidelines. c. The use of native trees, shrubs and grasses are encouraged. Native species found growing in the Plantation are preferred with Live, Laurel and Water Oaks, Spruce and Slash Pine, River Birch, Red Maple, Magnolia, Sweet Gum, Cabbage and Washingtonian Palm being the predominant tree species. 4. Site locations & Coverage: Existing and planted tree groupings may be under-planted with shrubs and ground covers and encompassed within a free form bed line. In site locations where trees are non-existent or in low population, shade/canopy trees shall be installed and distributed in such manner as to create a picturesque framework for the setting of the building and for the architectural character and profile of the house. A guide is included in Landscape Appendix B for the",
  "purpose of determining the number and spacing of trees to be added to open areas and to be used to supplement existing trees. All open spaces and particularly populated areas of the site shall be planted with shade/canopy type trees in order to achieve 40% canopy on the site. The above guide shall be utilized to determine the appropriate coverage utilizing the \"mean canopy spread\" in preparing the calculation. A calculation sheet shall be prepared for each plan submitted to the Board. The following canopy mix shall be minimum: Evergreen 75% Deciduous 15% Tree type shrubs and flowering ornamentals 10% Sabal palms may be utilized as substitutions for canopy/shade trees in such areas as along pool side. Sabal palms shall be planted in a minimum cluster of five (5) at a maximum spacing of 10 feet on center with staggered heights and a minimum of 8 feet of clear trunk. For purposes of calculation for canopy tree substitution, mean canopy spread shall be 35 feet on a cluster of",
  "five Sabal palms. 14. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS: 1. All air -conditioning units and pool equipment locations shall be shown on the landscape plans and appropriate screen walls and planting shall be provided. 2. Screen plantings for all garage openings shall be provided. 3. Specific tree types in front yards may be specified by the Architectural Design Board from time to time. 4. The construction of ostentatious site features such as topiary, sculpture, and freestanding fountains in the foregrounds of homes or lighting systems which may",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 51 - be offensive to adjacent neighbors will be unacceptable. All sculpture, flag poles, etc. must be approved by the ADB and landscaped appropriately. 5. No mailboxes will be installed curbside. 6. Any proposed exterior down lighting will be included on site and architectural plans for review and approval by the Architectural Design Board. Lighting of any color other than white must be specifically approved. Objectionable driveway lighting may be subject to review. Lights shall be carefully positioned so as not to shine on neighboring property. 7. No walls or hedges of plant material will be installed along the lot lines. However, the Architectural Design Board may consider such placement where lot configuration and placement warrant such installation. All hedges and walls must relate to and be an extension of the architectural form of the house and the outdoor space or activity being defined by any such walls or hedges. Any proposed walls must be included on the site and architectural plans for review",
  "and approval by the Architectural Design Board. Such plans shall include front, side, and end view, cross section, heights, materials, and colors. 8. Any plant material which dies or becomes unsightly after installation will be replaced with approved plants within 30 days of installation or any notification by the Architectural Design Board. When trees are removed at any time, stumps are to be ground so as not to be visible from roads, adjacent properties, golf course, etc. 9. The landscaping will be installed in accordance with the approved plan and any changes, additions, or deletions to the plan will be submitted to and approved by The Plantation ADB. 10 . Electric utility company guidelines specify that utility transformers must have 15' of clear area from the front of the transformer to the curb; mulch bed with ground covers less than ten inches in height at maturity or sod only. Sides and rear of transformer shall maintain a 36\" clear area from the box to the mature side of the shrub. The",
  "center of the shrub should be 54\" to the side of the box to allow for proper growth. Small trees shall be a minimum of 72\" from the box to prevent tree root invasion or interference by the tree canopy. 11. Traffic Sight Lines: Plantings should not hinder clear visibility of oncoming traffic both at the corner of corner lots and where driveways intersect at the street. 12. Drainage of the site: High amounts of impervious surface cause increased runoff that can affect the storm water retention areas. Slopes away from adjacent lots should be created to avoid runoff onto a nei ghbor’s property or into wetland areas, and at no time should any slope increase the runoff of an adjacent lot, built or vacant. Slopes should collect and divert runoff away from wetland areas and d rain the lots to the street, to the rear of the lot where water features exist and collect runoff from",
  "Amended January 28, 2014 - 52 - sides of lots adjoining other home sites or in concrete surrounded areas. Catch basins, percolation pipe, french drains and swales may be used to handle the runoff. 13 . Hardscaping: Consideration should be made to include pavers, stamped concrete, rock salt concrete and other hardscape surfaces rather than broom finished concrete for pool decks, walkways and driveways. Samples should be submitted with plans. If a pool or spa is a consideration, screen enclosure plans should be included as well. Variances are discouraged. Builders and architects should ensure adequate space for any of these amenities to include pool/spa equipment location and accompanying screen walls. Arbors, gazebos, etc. are reviewed on a case by case basis. 14 . Maintenance of Hedges in Garden Home Sections: Hedges in Garden Home Sections shall be maintained at a maximum height of eight feet. Exceptions, purely at the discretion of the Plantation Garden Home Maintenance Department, may be",
  "made regarding maximum hedge height where side or rear yard hedges are adjacent to roadways. 15 . Fertilization: It is recommended that fertilization be plant specific and applied annually in the spring. Additional applications for species such as Azaleas, Palms, Roses and annuals are encouraged quarterly for optimum growth. 16 . Tree Restrictions: Trees planted along the perimeter of the parcel shall not be planted in the front right of way. Maintaining equally proportioned spacing between trees is recommended. Tree growth should be anticipated when planting takes place. As much as possible, trees should be located so as not to impact adjacent properties at full growth. 17 . Planting restrictions: Plant materials should be selected to grow in their appropriate climate. Plants subject to freeze damage should be placed in protected micro climates; near walls, under tree canopies and where wind breaks can provide them with some protection from cold northwesterly winds. Plants damaged by frost shall be removed and replaced. All dead plant material is to be removed",
  "immediately and replaced if required.",
