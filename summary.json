    "executive_summary": "The Plantation at Ponte Vedra Beach is a deed-restricted equity community where ownership of a home automatically confers membership in the Association.  Membership rights (often called “Charter Memberships”) are tied to each parcel and cannot be sold separately.  By the bylaws, when a home is sold the membership passes to the new owner, and the board may terminate a membership for nonpayment according to the published credit policy.  Members are required to pay all Association charges (dues, fees, etc.) promptly per the credit policy.  The Association’s governing framework includes the Articles (not available for review), the Amended Bylaws, and a Declaration of Covenants (not seen in the sources), which together establish obligations such as maintaining homeowner insurance and preserving architectural standards.  In practice, the Board of Directors has broad authority: each director has one vote, and the Board “[may] exercise all powers … not expressly reserved to the Members,” subject to state law and the governing documents .  The Board is empowered to appoint committees (including a required Architectural Design Board, a Recruitment Committee, and a Grievance Committee, and an optional Executive Committee) and sets the annual budget at least 30 days before each fiscal year.  In short, the Board oversees operations, finances, committee charters and rules, while members capture rights to amenities and vote in elections.\n\nMembers must abide by published rules for all facilities.  For example, the golf course rules state that “Members … always play golf in the spirit of the game and conduct themselves in a respectful manner” .  The Plantation-wide rules specify that all roads are private and maintained by the Association, and that members must register and generally accompany their guests (guests holding approved guest cards are an exception).  During peak season (May 1–Sept 30), members may host up to six guests per day.  Each facility has its own rules: the Tennis/ Pickleball courts and Croquet lawns have hours and behavior policies (e.g. courts open at 8:30 am daily and members have priority using courts over guests), the Fitness Center requires a signed waiver before use and allows unsupervised use by age-15+ members with certification, and the Beach House/pool rules forbid bicycles on the pool deck.  Common-age restrictions apply (amenities may have age limits) and safety rules are enforced (e.g. the croquet lawn closes at sundown).\n\nViolations of rules and covenants trigger enforcement procedures.  The Association’s covenant enforcement policy (Grievance Committee Charter, etc.) provides that alleged violations are investigated and members receive notice of hearings.  Sanctions – from fines to suspension of privileges – may be imposed after a fair hearing.  For repeated or unresolved delinquencies, the rules allow suspension of membership privileges until the account is paid (statute 720.3085 is cited, e.g. suspension until 30 days after full payment).  Liens and collection measures follow nonpayment per policy.  In summary, the documents form a coherent set: the bylaws establish corporate structure and membership transfer, the Declaration (implied) and rules constrain land use and facility conduct, various committee charters and policies detail governance processes, and enforcement policies ensure compliance.  (Note: specific text from the Declaration or Articles of Incorporation was not found in the available documents.)",
