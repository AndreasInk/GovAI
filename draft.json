    "executive_summary": "Resident-owners of The Plantation automatically include membership rights to all community recreational amenities (golf course, beach club, tennis/pickleball courts, croquet lawns, fitness center, clubhouse, etc).  The governing documents (Declaration, Bylaws, and Rules/Policies) grant the Board authority to establish facility rules, committees, and operating procedures.  Members must use amenities in accordance with published rules and any posted policies at each facility (covering reservations, sign-in, attire, equipment care, and supervision of minors).  Guests are allowed only when accompanied by a member and under any guest limits or fees. Members must pay all dues; if assessments are delinquent (typically over 30 days), the Board may suspend all membership privileges .  Common restrictions apply: smoking or glass containers are generally banned in amenity areas, pets are not allowed on courts or inside club buildings, and quiet hours or noise limits must be observed.  Amenities operate only during designated hours (e.g. daylight or posted times), and advanced booking may be required for courts or events. An owner’s membership obligations include obeying all amenity rules and any Architectural or Covenants controls (where facilities do not override property-use covenants).  The Association disclaims liability for injuries in the facilities; members use them at their own risk.  Enforcement measures (fines, hearings, suspension of privileges) back up the rules  .  In summary, membership brings broad usage rights of all amenities, but every amenity is regulated by specific rules to ensure safety, fairness, and preservation of facilities, with penalties for violations.  (If any facility-specific manual was not found in the provided documents, it is assumed similar rules apply by analogy.)",
