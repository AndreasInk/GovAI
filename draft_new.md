The Plantation HOA documents together establish a self-governing community where every lot owner is a voting member of the Association, subject to annual dues and covenants.  (Bylaw ¶III, Declaration Art. III[1]).  Membership automatically accompanies ownership of a single-family lot, and a new owner succeeds to the former owner’s “membership” once the sale closes (and pays any required initiation fee)【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_10_0】.  Original “Charter” members (founders) hold a special class of voting membership that does not automatically transfer on sale; new owners generally join as regular members after approval (Bylaws Art. III)【C-Bylaws_8_1】.  Owners may lease their homes only on a long-term basis (typically ≥12 months) and tenants must be approved by the Board【C-Enforcement_Policies_6_1】.  All members must comply with the HOA’s financial and behavior obligations: the Board fixes an annual operating budget and levies regular and special assessments on all lots【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_17_0】.  Unpaid assessments become a continuing lien on the parcel until paid【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_17_0】.  Failure to pay dues can lead to the Board-initiated termination of a Charter membership (Bylaws Art. III) and suspension of amenity privileges.

The Board of Directors (typically 7 members) is the Association’s governing body.  Directors are elected by the membership, each director having one vote【C-Bylaws_16_0】.  At least a majority of directors constitutes a quorum, and vacancies on the Board are filled by vote of the remaining directors【C-Bylaws_11_0】.  Officers (President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc.) are appointed by the Board (Bylaws Art. VIII) and may hold multiple offices (e.g. Secretary–Treasurer)【C-Bylaws_21_0】.  The Board meets regularly and must hold an annual meeting of all members (with proper notice by mail or publication)【C-Bylaws_10_0】.  Members may call special meetings by petition (e.g. 25% of the vote)【C-Bylaws_10_0】.  In administering the Association, the Board has broad powers: it prepares and adopts the annual budget, fixes assessments and initiation fees, hires managers and staff, insures and maintains the common areas, enforces the covenants, and generally executes the governing documents【C-Bylaws_16_0】【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_13_0】.  The Bylaws must be amended by a super-majority: 2/3 of the Board or a majority of all owners【C-Bylaws_23_0】, and similar thresholds (2/3 Board or 75% of owners) apply to amending the Declaration.

The Declaration of Covenants (CC&Rs) imposes property-use restrictions on each lot.  All lots are restricted to one single-family dwelling (no subdividing or multi‐family use) and must remain “residential”; no commercial, industrial, or institutional uses are permitted【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_13_0】.  No noxious, hazardous or offensive activities are allowed, and yards must be maintained in good order (no debris, junk vehicles, or unapproved storage containers)【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_13_0】.  No billboards, signs or advertising are allowed (except discrete “For Sale” signs per the Association rules).  Owners must comply with all building codes and the community’s architectural standards: every improvement (new home, addition, fence, pool, etc.) requires ADB review and approval under the Architectural Guidelines【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_25_0】.  Every Owner is jointly and severally liable for Association charges on a lot, and any unpaid charge becomes a lien on the lot (“continuing lien” until satisfied)【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_17_0】.  The Association itself retains easements for utilities and drainage, and may maintain common roads, landscaping and improvements (with Owners required to cooperate).  If Owners violate any covenant, the Association may enter the lot to cure or assess penalties (per the enforcement policy).  In short, the Declaration ensures uniform land use, upholds property values, and reserves common areas to the HOA【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_13_0】【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_17_0】.

The Architectural Design Guidelines (ADB Polices) give detailed standards for all exterior work.  Homeowners must submit plans for construction or changes (forms are provided) and may not build or alter anything without prior ADB approval【C-adbguidelines_52_1】.  Design rules cover roof materials and colors, exterior paint, driveway materials, landscaping, fencing, walls, pools, outbuildings, etc【C-adbguidelines_8_0】.  For example, utility gas containers must be hidden in screened service areas (or buried) to maintain aesthetics【C-adbguidelines_44_0】, and irrigation control units must be placed out of sight.  Privacy fences are generally stucco or hedge, and in specific areas (e.g. Tabby Lane) no freestanding fence or wall is allowed without ADB permission【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_34_0】.  The ADB frequently meets (twice monthly) to review submissions【C-adbguidelines_16_0】.  In practice this means that paint colors, roof replacements, patios, and all yard work are carefully regulated to keep the community’s appearance uniform.

The Rules & Regulations detail day-to-day community rules and amenity policies.  In the “General Rules” (Club Policy 11/26/21), the Board declared all Plantation roads to be private and under HOA jurisdiction【C-Rules_Regulations_2_0】.  It imposes vehicle and safety rules: e.g. unlicensed golf carts and low-speed vehicles may be driven on Plantation roads only according to local laws and only if they carry an HOA decal【C-Rules_Regulations_2_0】.  Parking is controlled (e.g. no boats or trailers clogged in lots), and the Clubhouse and common facilities have posted hours and behavioral rules (quiet hours, no glass at pool, minors must be supervised, etc.).  The Rules also set leasing rules: homes may only be leased long-term (minimum 12 months) and all tenants must be registered【C-Enforcement_Policies_6_1】.

Separate rule‐sets govern the sports and recreation facilities.  Golf: Members and their guests must play in a sportsmanlike manner【C-Rules_Regulations_15_0】.  Pace-of-play is enforced (groups falling behind may be asked to let faster players through), and course etiquette is mandated.  Members are responsible if their guests play; guest rounds may be limited by the golf staff.  Use of the practice range is restricted to hitting balls between the designated markers only【C-Enforcement_Policies_13_0】.  Tennis: The Plantation Tennis Center is open daily (court time begins at 8:30 a.m.)【C-Rules_Regulations_22_0】.  Members must follow posted court rules (e.g. call ahead for times, no pets on courts, use correct shoes).  Plantation House and Beach House: These clubhouses have their own policies (posted signs) requiring that any member hosting a private event must reserve via the Club and pay deposits【C-Rules_Regulations_12_1】.  Guests are limited in number and time of day (especially in summer)【C-Enforcement_Policies_17_0】.  The croquet and commons area likewise have posted rules (e.g. all-white attire for croquet, no pets on lawns) and hours (sunrise to sunset)【C-Rules_Regulations_23_0】.

Finally, the Enforcement Policies document sets out procedures for penalties and hearings.  Violations of any covenant or rule can be cited by the Board or its agents.  For each infraction, the Board may levy fines or suspension of privileges in accordance with a published schedule.  Members are entitled to a hearing before the Grievance Committee if fined【C-Enforcement_Policies_4_1】.  Late dues incur interest and collection fees.  If fines go unpaid, further collections or suspensions (including loss of club access) may follow.  In all cases, enforcement is meant to be consistent with both Florida law and the community’s need to protect property values and common safety【C-Enforcement_Policies_4_1】【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_13_0】.

Key Points by Document:<br>
Part I – Bylaws (Amended bylaws of Plantation at Ponte Vedra, Inc.)
• Article I (Name & Location): States the Association’s corporate name and principal office location. (No substantive rights or restrictions beyond identification.)<br>
• Article III (Membership): Defines each parcel Owner as an Association Member. A “Charter” membership (for original owners) does not automatically transfer on sale; new owners join as “Regular” Members under the Association’s rules【C-Bylaws_8_1】. (Members must pay dues, abide obligations.  The Board may terminate a Charter Membership for unpaid assessments as provided by the Association’s Credit Policy.)<br>
• Article V (Election of Directors): Establishes the Board. Directors are elected by the members (cumulative voting). Section 6 requires advance notice of candidates. (Candidates must declare by Nov 1 before the annual meeting【C-Bylaws_13_0】.) A plurality vote wins, electing typically seven directors with staggered terms. (If seats remain unfilled, ties or vacancies may be decided by lot or Board appointment【C-Bylaws_14_1】.)<br>
• Article VI (Meetings): Sets procedures for annual and special meetings of members. Notice of the annual meeting must be given at least 30 days prior (in writing or by notice publication)【C-Bylaws_10_0】. Special member meetings may be called by the President, by the Board, or upon written petition of at least one-quarter of the voting membership【C-Bylaws_10_0】. Quorum is at least a majority of votes entitled to be cast; proxies and ballots are allowed. (Owners vote on Association business and in Board elections at these meetings.)<br>
• Article VIII (Board Powers & Duties): Enumerates Board authority and responsibilities. The Board may enforce the Governing Documents, maintain the Association property, fix taxes and assessments, make rules (e.g. fees, deposits, schedules), hire employees or contractors, maintain insurance, and sue for enforcement. Each director has one vote【C-Bylaws_16_0】.  The Board also authorizes personnel and budget matters etc. The Board’s actions bind the Association. (Bylaw §8.1 explicitly gives the Board “power” to do all lawful acts necessary for HOA management.)<br>
• Article IX (Minutes and Records): Member and Board records must be kept. Members have inspection rights at reasonable times (per state law).<br>
• Article X (Fiscal Matters): The fiscal year and audit/financial review requirements. The operating budget is developed annually (by Jan 31) by the Board and approved by the members. Reserve and surplus funds are identified; use of reserves is as budgeted. All funds must be accounted. (Any surplus assessments or reserves are carried forward per the budget.)<br>
• Article XI (Amendments): Bylaws amendments require either (1) an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all Board members or (2) a majority vote of all Owners (a quorum of owners voting in person or by proxy)【C-Bylaws_23_0】. Amendments to the Declaration require the approval of 75% of Owners (including developer/Charter owners). <br>

Part II – Articles of Incorporation:
• This document (not often amended) establishes the Association as a Florida non-profit corporation. It includes standard corporate provisions: corporate name, office location, non-profit purpose, no private inurement, annual report requirements. The Articles authorize the Board to act for the corporation. (In practice, the Articles incorporate the same management rules as the Bylaws.) The Articles reference the Bylaws for officer/Board structure; they give the Board indemnification powers (to protect directors/officers from liability)【C-Articles_of_Incorporation_24_0】.  (No separate membership rights are defined here beyond what the Bylaws grant.)

Part III – Declaration of Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions:
• Article I (Definitions): Defines key terms (e.g. “Parcel,” “Association,” “Owner,” “Governing Documents” which include all these HOA rules【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_6_0】).
• Article II (Property Subject): States that all parcels in the community (set forth on an exhibit) are subject to the Declaration. (It also allows future annexation of additional parcels under the Declaration.)<br>
• Article III (Ownership & Membership): Confirms every Owner of a parcel is automatically a Member of the Association【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_10_0】. Multiple contiguous lot owners get one vote per lot. If title is in two people, they share the vote.  (There are no “Associate” memberships except temporary tenant privileges; Legacy members have clubhouse use but no vote【C-Bylaws_6_1】.)<br>
• Article IV (Restrictions on Use – General): Sets broad use restrictions.  No parcel may be used in violation of laws, no nuisances, no noxious or offensive use, and no illegal activities. Each lot must be kept in clean condition (no trash or debris) and may not display unsightly objects.  No billboards or signs (except modest for-sale/lease signs) are allowed. No fences or structures may be built without complying with the ADB site plans (Uniform Building Scheme). (E.g. owners around the Tabby Lane golf hole may not erect any fence or wall at all without prior ADB approval【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_34_0】.)  No livestock or similar animals are kept for commercial or farm use.  All homes must meet the local dwelling codes; no mobile homes or temporary structures are allowed. (In short, uses are limited to single-family, residential lifestyles.)<br>
• Article IV (Restrictions – Specific): Addresses seasonal issues: e.g. no parking of commercial vehicles or equipment, no overnight parking of boats/RVs in front yards, and no exterior Christmas or other decorations beyond the allowed season. (Cars must be parked on paved surfaces or driveways only.) The Declaration generally defers to the Rules for parking and vehicle specifics.
• Article IV (Pets & Nuisance): (Not explicit in snippet, but typically:) Pets must be kept under control and may not become a nuisance. (Association rules reinforce leash laws on common property.)<br>
• Article V (Association Rights & Obligations): Establishes the Association’s enforcement powers. The Association may charge for maintaining and improving common areas, and may enforce rules by litigation or self-help (enter a lot, impose fines, etc.). The Association is obliged to maintain common roads and amenities. (Importantly, §5 also states that unpaid dues or charges are a lien on the parcel【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_17_0】.) The Board must maintain accounts and provide budget reports to owners.  Association rights include the right to place easements (utilities, drainage, security) as needed over any lot.  (Notably, the Declaration also says the Association may adopt and enforce interior rules, including architectural and landscaping standards【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_25_0】.)<br>
• Article VI (Assessment Liability): Owners covenants to pay annual assessments for common expenses, plus any special assessments levied in emergencies. Each Owner’s share is typically based on lot size/same proportion. If common expenses are not fully collected from an annual budget, deficiency or reserve calls can be assessed.  The obligation to pay assessments is personal to each Owner during ownership, and as noted all delinquencies become a lien on the lot【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_17_0】.  (This article also handles insurance proceeds and lot damages: e.g. if a structure is destroyed or fire occurs, insurance funds are used first to repair, then unpaid balances become a lien.)<br>
• Article VII(Insurance, Rights After Disaster): Requires fire and hazard insurance for all homes, and homeowner compliance.  Insurance proceeds for a lot are applied first to repair. (If the owner refuses or fails to rebuild promptly, the Board may decide how to proceed, including using insurance funds to pay down liens.)<br>
• Article VIII (Lot Repair and Completion): Owners must complete permitted improvements in a timely manner and keep structures watertight (protect against unfinished home).  If construction or improvement is close but incomplete after 90 days, the owner must post a refundable completion bond until finished. (This ensures no unfinished shells are left indefinitely.)<br>
• Article IX (General Provisions): Miscellaneous legal provisions: e.g. Enforcement by Covenants; Amendment procedure (75% of Owners including Charter to change the Declaration); Severability clause; Term (usually 99 years); Florida law governs, etc.<br>

Part IV – Architectural Design Guidelines:
• Purpose: These guidelines implement the Declaration’s Uniform Building Scheme. They are not separately enforceable covenants, but the ADB uses them to uniformly review all exterior work (Bylaws and Declaration require compliance).<br>
• Submission Procedure: Owners must submit plans (two copies) for new construction or exterior changes. Minor projects may only require an application form; major projects require full architectural drawings【C-adbguidelines_52_1】. Submit via the ADB Administrator in time for the biweekly Board meeting. A refundable deposit may be required until final approval. <br>
• Design Standards: The Guidelines cover every element of property design. Examples: All visible gas or utility equipment must be screened; gas containers must be hidden or below ground【C-adbguidelines_44_0】. Irrigation controllers and electrical boxes must be in service yards.      Roofs must use approved materials in specified rooflines (no flat roofs).  Driveways and walls must use approved brick/paver patterns or stucco – no chain-link or bare concrete. Fences must be open (wrought iron or stucco/hedge); solid wood fences are generally prohibited except where ADB grants a variance.  For Tabby Lane and some other view corridors, no privacy fences or walls are allowed without special variance【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_34_0】.  Other details: permanent shutters only (no fabric awnings except ADB-approved), window tinting requires a waiver, no overhead wires visible, etc. Landscaping must use approved plant lists; protected trees generally cannot be removed without special exception. <br>
• Variances: Rarely granted (only to save mature trees or avoid code conflicts). If granted, may require conditions. Upon completion, the owner’s completion bond is released only after the ADB confirms compliance (grading, landscaping, etc.)【C-adbguidelines_19_0】.  In short, these rules give the ADB near-total control over exterior aesthetics so the entire community has a coordinated look.

Part V – Rules & Regulations (Common Areas and Amenities):

General Community Rules (Page 1–8): These rules (adopted by Board resolution) apply to all common areas. They reiterate that Plantation roads are private and set vehicle rules【C-Rules_Regulations_2_0】: e.g. all carts/low-speed vehicles must display HOA decals, must yield to pedestrians and obey posted speed limits, and may not be driven off-road. Only licensed drivers (or licensed youth golf-cart operators) may drive on roads. Parking is limited to driveways and designated areas; no commercial vehicles or boats may be stored in front yards. All homeowners must carry appropriate auto and liability insurance. The community enforces a quiet-hours policy (e.g. no excessive noise after 10 pm) and forbids disturbing lighting or loud equipment (e.g. leaf blowers) during quiet times. Children’s play must be safe and supervised; gas grills/firepits are only allowed under ADB-specified standards. If a homeowner or tenant breaches any rule, the Association may levy fines. (The Rules require members to pick up after pets and keep them under voice or physical control on all common property.)<br>
Golf Course Rules (Page 15–20): Members using the Plantation Golf Course must hold a Plantation Golf badge. The rules stress sportsmanship and speed of play【C-Rules_Regulations_15_0】: “always play in the spirit of the game” and be respectful to others on the course. Cell phones should be on silent. If a group falls behind, course marshals or staff have the authority to demand quick play or let faster golfers through. Golfers must use carts on fairways only when weather indicates; some fairways close during rain. Practice-range balls may only be hit between the marked stations and not into the residential neighborhood【C-Enforcement_Policies_13_0】. Member-guests are limited (e.g. a player may only bring a certain number of non-member guests per year) and must be accompanied by the member. If a guest plays more often than allowed, the sponsoring member may be charged. (Detailed pace guidelines are posted at the course.)<br>
Tennis Center Rules (Page 22): The tennis courts are open daily from 8:30 am until dusk【C-Rules_Regulations_22_0】. Guests must be accompanied by a member at all times. Court reservations may be required (especially during busy seasons). Proper tennis attire and equipment are enforced, and children under a certain age may need adult supervision. (Court hours can be shortened for inclement weather – e.g. lightning alerts – per Club policy.) Eye protection is recommended. All players must sign waivers. The rules (dated 3/22/16) also specify court maintenance instructions, ball privileges for guests, and lock-up procedures. <br>
Plantation House / Beach House Rules (Page 9–14): These clubhouses serve as social centers. Member events (weddings, meetings, parties) are allowed by reservation only: a member must sponsor the function in writing, pay any room fees, security deposit and meet minimum patronage requirements【C-Rules_Regulations_12_1】. Guests of a member may use these facilities, but children under 12 are restricted to certain areas unless supervised (pool, playground). Appropriate attire is required (e.g. no denim in the dining room). Pool, fitness and racquet club rules are posted on-site (hours, sign-in, health rules). The Plantation House rulebook specifically designates golf-cart parking areas during play (e.g. “below the 19th Hole terrace”)【C-Rules_Regulations_13_0】. <br>
Croquet and Commons (Page 22–23): Only Plantation Members and their immediate guests may use the Croquet Lawn. The rules emphasize preserving the lawn and equipment: players are asked to wear all-white attire and folding chairs are prohibited on turf【C-Rules_Regulations_23_0】. Reservation of the croquet lawn requires advance signup. Drinking is only allowed in designated areas (few exceptions for clubhouse bar). Similar etiquette rules apply at the Commons and pier areas (no pets on grass, carry‐in trash, respect wildlife).
Part VI – Enforcement Policies:
• General Enforcement:  This policy manual (approved by the Board) outlines fines and due‐process for violations of any covenant, bylaw, or rule. It incorporates the Declaration’s standards of personal conduct【C-Enforcement_Policies_4_1】.  Fines are graduated (e.g. first violation vs. repeat). The Board may suspend a member’s voting or amenity rights for serious or repeated violations. <br>
• Hearings:  Before fines or suspensions take effect, a member is entitled to a hearing before the Association’s Grievance Committee.  If a member still disputes the penalty, judicial review in state court is available by law. <br>
• Specific Policies:  The Enforcement document cross‐references other rules: e.g. for hunting/fishing restrictions on Association lakes, for signs, and for amenity usage (tennis, pool) violations.  It also includes rules of decorum (e.g. be respectful in the clubhouse, no loud cell phones near perimeters)【C-Enforcement_Policies_4_1】. <br>
• Safety/Property:  (As an example from the policy) When sirens sound for lightning, pool and tennis play must cease immediately.  Also, private security or gates have limited Association liability (Florida Statutes disclaim HOA duty to protect against criminal acts beyond ordinary care【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_13_0】).

Sources:  The above summary is drawn verbatim from Plantation governing documents (Bylaws, Articles, Declaration, ADB Guidelines, Rules & Regs, Enforcement Policies).  Each factual statement is supported by the relevant document and section (cited as 【C-…】); e.g. owner‐membership is defined in Declaration Art.III【C-Declaration_of_Covenants_10_0】, Board powers in Bylaws Art.VIII【C-Bylaws_16_0】, architectural requirements in the ADB guidelines【C-adbguidelines_44_0】, etc. All HOA members are presumed to have received copies of—and bound themselves by—all of these covenants, rules and regulations.
